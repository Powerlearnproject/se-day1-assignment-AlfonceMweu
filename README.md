#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of engineering and computer science that deals with the application of a systematic and disciplined approach to the development of software that is reliable and works efficiently on machines.its important in that it enables the development of software applications and systems that are abstract and intagible that power various aspects of life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.The  development of prioogframming languanges led to writikng of codes that were readable and edasy to cdebugg.
2.The establishment of softare engineering as a discipline emphasized the use of structured methed to develop sotfware reducing its complexity.
3.The rise of agile methodologies that emphasize on iterative development over rigid plannning. 
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Identifying the problem ,oportunities and objectives-this helps to evaluate whether the project is worth pursuing(feasibility report).
2.Analysis of user needs and requirements-the software engineer gathers the user preferences on the software through interviews,questionares and surveys.
3.designing the software- this includes designs for data entry  procedures,the human computer interface,datbase,back up procedures and the system controls.
4.Developing and documenting the software-this  includes writing the code,debugging and documenting it.
5.Testing-tests the modules,the intergration of the modules and nthe software as a whole.
6.Deployment-release the softwre to the user.
7.Maintainace-repetedly provide updatdes to the softwareto keep with evolving timmes.   m 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodologies is a step by step methodology in which the next step is reached once the current step is finishedit is most suitable for projects that are stable,plan driven and well defined for example softwares  projects for  banks while agile methodoligies are iterative in nature in that the project  is divided into smaller manageable portions that allow for continous feedback and changes,they are most suitable for projects with changing requirements ie web and app development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer is responsible for programmming the software,debugging and implenting it.
The quality assurance engineer looks up the  softaware to see if it of  good quality by designing and executing test plans.
The project manager  oversees the entire process of software development which includes the planning,design,coding,execution and testing.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated development environment are software siutes that provide comprehensive tools for writing,debugging and testing code,they include vs code and codeblocks.
version control sysytemsa are sokftware tools used to track changes in the source code and coordinating team or group activities, they iclude GitHub and subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines-unrealistic timelines accompanied with pressure to deliver the software can be very stressful and can lead to rushed development and diminish the quality, to adddress this priotise tasks and clearly negotiate timelines with stakeholder with consideration of the workload.
Changing requirements-frequently changing requirements can slow the developpment progress leading to delays,use  of agile methodologies and constant interaction and communication with users and stakeholders can be used to remedy this.
Debugging and error correction-developing a software requires very many lines of codes this makes debugging difficult and time consuming,this also happens during testing where error detection and correction can be challenging,to overcome this use test units to detect errors in advance and automated testing tools like selenium.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is a discipline that involves writing and crafting prompts and enquiries to AI models that short,concise and clear to get  the best responses. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effect
